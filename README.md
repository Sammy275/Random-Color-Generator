# color_generator

An application that generates random color in the background on touch.
If you long press the screen then you will be taken to a new section. The new section shows you the temperature of any place but you will have to enter the coordinates for that place.
I have tried to write the code so that it can be scalable and readable.

## Getting Started

The project was developed on Flutter version 3.7.3.
